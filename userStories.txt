Workflow:
1. I want to hide the user profile unless they're logged in
    - First, I need to be able to tell if they're logged in or not
    - Maybe I'll have this currentCustomer thing that I keep track of, that will be null before I log in (So once they 'login', the current customer is not null, and has current customer info)
    - And then once I know that it's not null, then I'll display teh user profile
2. Prompt the user to log in (if they haven't)
    - I need to go back to the log in menu (of a sort)
    - And then give them log in screen again
3. Render user profile
    - First, I need to display all current prescriptions and refill/reminder schedule
    - They can add/edit/delete prescriptions, and create new reminders for those prescriptions
    - Once they add a new prescription, it auto-populates in the refill schedule
